				  Thermostat


Review Question 1 (Cost Analysis):

Assume we are building 1000 units of this system.  Use the provided part
numbers (see the webpage) and the digikey.com or jameco.com website to find the
total **cost per unit** (again assume we build a quantity of 1000 units) for
these thermostats.  Itemize the part costs (list each part and its unit cost
when bought in units of 1000) and then show the final cost per unit below.
Note: You only need to price the components used in the project (not all the
components in your lab kit.  Also, you do not need to account for the cost of
the circuit board or wires. In a real environment we would manufacture a PCB
(Printed Circuit Board). As an optional task, you can search online for PCB
manufacturers and what the costs and options are in creating a PCB.

Parts used for project

Arduino(A000066) x 1 = $27.60 for 1
LCD Shield(Gravity: 1602 LCD Keypad Shield For Arduino) x 1 = 10+ $8.90
240ohm resistor(CFR-25JB-52-240R) x 2 = 1,000 for	$11.44
1300ohm resistor(CFR-25JB-52-1K3) x 1 = 1,000 for	$11.44
4700ohm resistor(CFR-25JB-52-4K7) x 1 = 1,000 for	$11.44
Button(Multicolor Buttons - 4-pack) x 2 = 500pack(2000 buttons) for $790.00
Rotary Encoder(3315Y-001-016L + 14.6mm Black and Blue Knob with Set Screw for 0.125 Inch Shaft) x 1 = 1,000	for $2,437.23 & 500+ for $0.89 each
Buzzer(CEM-1206S) x 1 = 1,000 for $406.98
Servo Moter(Micro servo - TowerPro SG92R) x 1 = 100+	for $4.76 each
RGB LED(Chanzon 100 pcs 5mm RGB Multicolor Diffused LED Diode Lights Common Anode(Frosted Round Tricolor) 4 pin Bright Lighting Bulb Lamps Electronics Components Indicator Light Emitting Diodes) x 1 = 10(of 100pcs set), 89.90 for 1000
ANALOG DEVICES DS18B20+ x 1 = 500+ for $4.16 each

1000 Arduino => 27.60 * 1000 = $27600
1000 LCD Shield => 8.90 * 1000 = $8900
1000 240ohm resistor => 11.44 * 2 = $22.88
1000 1300ohm resistor => $11.44
1000 4700ohm resistor => $11.44
1000 Button => $790
1000 Rotary Encoder => 2,437.23 + 890 = $3327.23
1000 Buzzer => $406.98
1000 Servo Moter => $4760
1000 RGB LED => $89.90
1000 ANALOG DEVICES DS18B20+ => $4160

All added up together = 50079.87

cost per unit = 50.07987




Review Question 2 (Health/Safety/Reliability)

Assume this system was to be sold to consumers for use at their home.

Considering reliability, health, and safety...

 - What scenarios might you suggest testing (considering both HW and SW) 
    before releasing the product for use? 

      Test operation across expected temperature ranges - e.g. 40-100째F to ensure proper functionality. Check boundary cases like 40째F, 100째F.
      Test setting high and low temperature thresholds across the allowed range (50-90째F) and invalid ranges. Check functionality when thresholds are set to the same value.
      Check system behavior when temperature changes very rapidly for cases when the door is opened/closed.
      Test operation for extended periods of time - days, weeks. Check for memory leaks, resource issues.
      Test what happens when power is disconnected and reconnected. Check that settings are restored properly.
      Check behavior when control buttons are pressed very rapidly or concurrently.
      Consider environmental factors - test operation in high/low humidity, high/low temperatures, dusty conditions, loud noise, etc.
      Consider safety testing - check for electrical safety, thermal safety.
      Test installation in sample homes under real-world conditions.

 - How might you make your design more reliable? By reliability we don't just
   mean keeping it running correctly (though you should consider that), but
   also how you can detect that a connected component has failed to gracefully
   handle such situations.  You can consider both HW and SW points of failure,
   issues related to the operational environment, etc. and how to mitigate
   those cases.

      Add redundancy in critical components like the temperature sensor. Have a secondary sensor to detect faults.
      Improve power supply filtering, add reset supervision circuit to handle power transients.
      Implement robust sensor error handling - if sensor disconnects have safe fallback operation.
      Protect memory for critical data like setpoints - use error correction codes.
      Improve enclosure seals for humidity/dust protection. Conformal coating on PCBs.
      Monitor temperature sensor readings for abnormal rates of change as an early failure indication.
      Log critical events to persistent memory to help post-failure debugging.
